================

Here's an image:

.. image:: /_static/logo.png

And this is a figure:

.. figure:: /_static/logo.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: map to buried treasure

   This is the caption of the figure (a simple paragraph).

   The legend consists of all elements after the caption.  In this
   case, the legend consists of this paragraph.
